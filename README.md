# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

	Analysis of Various mediums production success.
	
### Purpose
	
	To provide Louise a comparison of other productions relative to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	To see whether the month the production was released had any bearing on the success of the production.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	To see whether the production budget goal had any bearing on the success of the production. I compared budget goals in $5000 increments to see if the size of the 
	production had changed the probablity of success.
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	My biggest challenge so far has been in using Git. Aside from using git insuring you are using the correct data set to perform analysis is key. Using
	the amount funded instead of the using the goal for comparison won't allow

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	
	The first conclusion is that theater patrons seem to like going to shows during the months of May the most. The data shows that the rate of successful 
	launch of a production rose at a higher rate than the rest of the year. The rest of the year failed productions track with successful ones. Also more 
	productions were released in the spring and summer than other times of the year. In December shows are just as likely to succeed as fail which is why this 
	is the month that has the fewest productions. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
	The probablity of a productions success or failure at a specific goal range is inverse. This is because there were no canceled theater productions. 
	Productions whos goals were between 15000 to 19999 was the only range in which the production was just as likely to succeed as fail. Productions that spent 
	45000 or more had a failure rate of over 80%

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
	The data only uses one variable the budget of various productions. It doesn't specify if this is just what is needed to put on a play or if it includes,
	venue, fame of actor, director, writter, genre of production, marketing expenses or a variety of other factors that could lead to the success or failure
	of a production.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
	Other tables that could or graphs that could be used to show these results are bar graphs, scatter plots, box & whisker could all provide similar detail.
